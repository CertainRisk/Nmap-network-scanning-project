This project was completed in July but I wanted to document what I've learned about Nmap. 

Project purpose: 
  - Verify the Nmap installation and Nmap version that are installed on a system by using the terminal. 
  - Identification of potential vulnerabilities on a network.
  - Exploration of Nmap scanning of a network to discover active hosts, open ports and other running services.
